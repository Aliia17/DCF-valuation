# DCF-valuation
# DCF Valuation Project

This project contains a comprehensive **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation** analysis of a publicly listed company ("Fastenal"), completed as part of my **Corporate Finance coursework** at Nazarbayev University.

## Objective

To assess the **intrinsic value** of a company by applying DCF methodology, compare it with its **current market valuation**, and provide a justified **investment recommendation** based on financial and strategic analysis.

## What the Project Includes

### Free Cash Flow Forecast
- Projected **Free Cash Flows (FCFs)** for a 5-year horizon
- Based on realistic assumptions about **revenue growth, margins**, and **operating performance**

### Terminal Value Estimation
- Estimated using the **Gordon Growth Model**  
- Reflects the company’s value beyond the explicit forecast period

### WACC Calculation
- Computed the **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)** as the discount rate  
- Considered capital structure, cost of equity (via CAPM), and cost of debt

### Key Assumptions
- Clearly stated and justified all critical inputs:
  - **Revenue growth rates**
  - **EBIT margins**
  - **Reinvestment rates**
  - **Terminal growth rate**
  - **WACC**

### Sensitivity Analysis
- Explored how changes in:
  - **WACC**
  - **Terminal growth rate**
  - **EBIT margin**
  
  affect the **intrinsic value**, helping assess downside and upside risks

### Intrinsic Valuation & Recommendation
- Derived the **intrinsic value per share**
- Compared it to the **current market price**
- Issued a recommendation to **Buy**, **Hold**, or **Sell**, supported by quantitative and qualitative reasoning
